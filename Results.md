Two most important performance metrics i.e accuracies and misclassification rates for all the three classifiers used are calculated and are as follows:
Accuracies:

Support Vector Machine:     85.59 %
Artificial Neural Network:  86.15 %
XGBoost:                  	89.07 %

Misclassification rate:

Support Vector Machine: 	14.41 %
Artificial Neural Network:13.85 %
XGBoost:                	10.93 %
